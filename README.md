Dataset

We used 311_Service_Requests_2020.csv, which consists of calls to the 311 phone number for non-emergency services in New York City in the year 2020. 

Analysis

First, in the file Top10.ipynb, we identified the top 10 causes of calls to 311 in zipcode 11101. Then, in the file Parking.ipynb, we analyzed the proportion of illegal parking incidents in both zipcode 11101 and all regions in the dataset.
